# julia2mathematica
Building modules to integrate Julia with Wolfram Mathematica.
* Need to be able to send expressions to evaluate in Mathematica and get results for further processing
* Features implemented so far:
  1. Ability to send Wolfram expressions that evaluate to a scalar value
  2. Ability to send Wolfram expressions that evaluate to a a list(TimeSeries)
